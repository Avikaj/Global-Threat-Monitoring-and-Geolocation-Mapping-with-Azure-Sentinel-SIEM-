# Global-Threat-Monitoring-and-Geolocation-Mapping-with-Azure-Sentinel-(SIEM)

#Project CHaracterstics
1.  Setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot.
2.  We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world.
3.  We will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map.
